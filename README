Tree Status
===========

This is a simple wsgi app to maintain the open/closed state of development
trees. It has a simple REST API, and a horrible web interface.

Deployment
==========
python setup.py install

edit who.ini to your liking. in particular, audiences should match the public
url of the site. secret should also be changed to something random.

python testapp.py for local testing

treestatus.wsgi can be used as a template for wsgi deployments
